-   Membership access. In order to gain access to certain service / product users
    are required to "deposit" their nft and get wrapped one. With this wrapped token they can enjoy service / product while underlying nft belongs to them. They can opt out at any time.

-   Additional functionality. Say users poses nfts of huge value (bored ape yacht, pudgy penguin).
    Then some new extension of ERC721 is created which offer new UX etc.
    Users would be able to wrap their existing (and expensive) nfts without loosing any value but at the same time gaining new functionality.

-   Staking. Again by depositing the nft users will acquire certain rewards, like in ERC20 tokens.
